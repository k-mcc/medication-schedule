# Medication Schedule

*Â© 2021 Kate McCarthy*

### Purpose:
To simplify the recovery of surgical patients, I created a website called MedSched. 

### How it works:
Patients enter as many medications as they need and schedule the times to take each. After clicking "Create Schedule," MedSched generates a medication schedule with visible labels and bright colors on a printable timetable. I am  planning on publishing the website.

### Programming Languages:
HTML, CSS, Javascript, & PHP
